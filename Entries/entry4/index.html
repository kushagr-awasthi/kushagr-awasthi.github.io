            <p>Saket Suman of Business Standard wrote in his review: "What Tharoor does, and succeeds in doing, is show his readers what Modi said and says, and what he and his government did during the four years of their rule so far."</p>

            <p><strong>Personal Thoughts</strong> One cannot expect to get the truth from a politician, I am not naive, however I do believe there lies some merit in maintaining connections to the views of many people of varied experience and situation. And whilst my biases towards the argument that Mr. Tharoor shall surely posit are predictabely present, in an environment where the titular man holds perhaps the only megaphone, perhaps it is understandable for me to sink into the solace of knowing that someone else's views match my own.</p>
