            <h1>A Dilemma of Females</h1>
            <h2>Are Women a second class citizenry in cottage-industry India?<br><br>
                Understanding Gender Roles with <em>“Daughters of India: Art and Identity”</em> by Stephen P. Huyler
            </h2>
            <h3>Kushagr Awasthi, September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2022.</h3>
            <p>The craft industries of India are famed for their painstaking creation of highly patterned ornamental and decorative items. They showcase the breadth of talent and skill that has been passed down, despite the burden of poverty, strife and war; they showcase the very paradox that is humanity, that despite the brutalities imposed by a biological need for survival, we are compelled to creation and material manipulation.<br><br>

                Yet despite the manner in which, in modernity, these arts have allowed for the upliftment of rural geographies, perhaps we must begin to question, exactly which traditions we are perpetuating: those of visuo-cultural import or those of mysoginistic subjugation! If women and girls are kept out of school so they can produce crafts that their husbands profit off of economically, what moral goal can lie in the continued efforts to cement these crafts as modern commodities! <br><br>
                
                If women are kept out of monetary independence because the market has chosen to maintain an oppressive status quo, despite an inherent love for aesthetic, shouldn’t we just let these dying crafts die!?
