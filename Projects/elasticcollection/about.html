    <p >Welcome to my archive of design references and sources for Indian designers!</p>
    <p>
      I am a passionate individual who believes in the power of design to make a positive impact on the world we live in. As a designer myself, I understand the importance of having access to a comprehensive platform where I can explore and expand my knowledge and skills in the field of design.
    </p>
    <p>
      My archive is a labor of love, featuring an extensive collection of design resources and references that I have carefully curated over the years. It includes books, articles, scholarly essays, and references on inter-arts exploration with music, architecture, and crafts. It covers all aspects of design, from graphic design and product design to fashion design and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a solo project, I am dedicated to ensuring that my archive is always up-to-date and relevant, constantly adding new resources and sources to keep it engaging and informative. I also provide a platform for Indian designers to showcase their work and connect with others in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, design is not just about aesthetics, but also about functionality and sustainability. I strive to embrace these principles in my work and encourage others to do the same. I believe that design has the power to create positive change and I am committed to using it as a tool to make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are a seasoned designer or just starting out, my archive has something for everyone. I invite you to explore my collection and discover the endless possibilities of design, and its connections with music, architecture, crafts, and other arts.
