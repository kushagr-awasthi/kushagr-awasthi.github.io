<p>References for The Indian Designer is a collection of socio-cultural, aesthetic ephemera, largely from India and by Indian designers, artists and other creators. This website is not meant to be exhaustive, nor definitive, indeed, I must acknowledge that I have found no complete standard for “Indian Design” or “Indian Designer,” nor do I pretend to propagate any such definition, for it would be a pointless and reductive exercise. Thus, whilst this website does indeed state that it is for “the” Indian designer, it might be better termed for “an” Indian Designer or even just Design References for Kush.</p>
<p>The use of “Indian” as a term in the name of the project is necessary, however, when we look the extant curricula that is taught at Art and Design Schools around the world. With a definitive, standardised western design canon, replete with canonical designers, we must formulate a similar canon for eastern design. This exercise will always mean that certain less-fundamental movements, artists and perspectives are glossed over, though perhaps the dynamism and accessibility of a web archive could always strive to mitigate this effect. Ultimately, the website serves to provide a macro-view of past aesthetic heritage and more contemporary trends that form the visual topography of the Indian Subcontinent. I also want to state with crystal-clarity, that, in many ways, this website remains a visualisation of the sub-conscious traits of my, personal design practice and my socio-political, cultural and moral perspectives. I also want to talk of authenticity. I am a privileged Indian, my circumstances are far devolved from those of the average Indian, the average Indian cannot afford to study in pre-eminent design institutions in the United States. In many ways I question whether I have the ethical grounding to claim to be “Indian” and then to be seen as representative of India, at large.  Even historically, the artist-intellectuals of India have been an urban, westernised elite who have borrowed amply from albeit indigenous but agrarian, <em>rural and non-commodified </em>craft, ornamentation, and decoration cultures to further benefit themselves or their employers. That this archive could seek to do the same is not lost on me. That the aesthetic vernacular of the average Indian could be exploited by someone like me to garner sympathy and appreciation at the international and commercial stage.</p>
<p>I cannot aim to know every use case for this archive, and I believe in the fundamental moral core at the heart of humanity. I find that documenting India is a worthy task, despite an archive’s ability to create biases, stereotypes and winners/losers.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy looking at the project!</p>
