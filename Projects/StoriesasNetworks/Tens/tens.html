            Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book <em>Poetic Closure:
                A Study of How Poems End,</em> says this: “Perhaps all 
            we can say, and even this may be too much, is that
             varying degrees or states of tension seem to be 
             involved in all our experiences, and that the most
              gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions
               are created are also released. Or, to use another 
               familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying 
               to the extent that those expectations that are aroused
                are also fulfilled.”

            But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin.
             How can the origin be <em>traced</em> when there is no form or shape that
              precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of
               the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning,
                before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to 
                the precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, 
                and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself was born.
