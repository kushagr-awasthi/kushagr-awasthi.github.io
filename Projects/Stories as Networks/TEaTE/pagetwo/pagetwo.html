        I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end,
        huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: The End. I miss
        finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance
        from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling
        The End.
        </p>
        <p id="P2">
        It was its own thrill. I didnâ€™t ignore them, I read them, even if only 
        silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete,
        a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having
        finished the book.
        </p>
        <p id="P3"> I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End.
        Why is that, I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to
        novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy, no
        marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I found a
        poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade, and
        at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from the rest
        of the text, were the words The End. And I realized children very often
        denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have
        written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of stories
        and poems that have already been written; they know some, of course, but
        have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons
        residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and stories like
        kings. Which is a wonderful thing.
